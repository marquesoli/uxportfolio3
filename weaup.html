              <h5>
                How might we enable individuals suffering from "text neck" to
                integrate posture correction into their daily lives while making
                it an enjoyable and engaging activity?
              </h5>

              <p>
                As mobile device usage continues to increase, there is a growing
                need for solutions that address the health impacts of poor
                posture. By leveraging smartphone capabilities, we can create an
                app that encourages healthier habits and helps reduce the risk
                of neck pain.

            </h5>

            <p>
              The initial challenge of addressing "Text Neck" was broad, as poor
              posture can result from various behaviors and affect a wide range
              of individuals. To create an effective solution, we focused on how
              to seamlessly integrate posture correction into users' daily
              routines while making the process engaging and sustainable through
              our app.

              We decided to focus on people who have back and neck pain. "Text

              After conducting a detailed competitor analysis, we learned about
              the strengths and weaknesses of existing posture monitoring apps
              in the market, but with our user-centered approach, we needed to
              deeper understand our target audience.
            </h5>

            <p>
              To achieve this, we conducted a series of qualitative user
              interviews to uncover the needs and challenges related to
              improving neck posture and posture correction. We spoke with a
              diverse group of people, including office workers, students,
              athletes and health-conscious individuals to make sure we could
              explore different perspectives and their use cases.

            </h5>

            <p>
              Users often only address posture issues when discomfort becomes
              severe. Motivation can fluctuate due to busy schedules and varying
              levels of discomfort. Our strategy is to maintain consistent
              motivation by integrating social and gamified elements into daily
              posture routines.

                developed the information architecture to structure content
                logically, facilitating easy access to key features.
              </h5>

              <p>
                Additionally, we explored and refined our app essential

                incorporating insights from user interviews and competitor

              enabled us to refine the user experience continuously.

            <h5>User testing helped us identify key areas for improvement.</h5>
            <p>
              Initially, our concept focused primarily on individual posture
              correction. However, during testing with users, we received
              feedback that emphasized the importance of social interaction and
              group support in maintaining motivation. This insight that we got
              early in the design process led us to iterate our solution,
              incorporating Collaborative Challenges where users could set
              shared goals and support each other, enhancing both engagement and
              effectiveness.
